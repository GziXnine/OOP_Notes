### 📌 Notes

> **Important:** All code is written in C++ with Standard C++11 features. Make sure your compiler supports at least C++11 standard.   
> **Tip:** Each day builds on previous days. Follow the sequence for best learning outcomes.   
> **Practice:** The more you code, the better you understand. Try to solve tasks without looking at solutions first.
